On Tick is the heart of our EA, (break) called on every price tick. (long-break) We follow a logical sequence. (break) First, update account values like balance and equity. (break) Then update equity tracking and calculate drawdowns. (break) Next, monitor the killswitch to see if we need to close positions. (long-break) We check for new closed trades and update statistics accordingly. (break) The dashboard is updated every second, (break) not on every tick, (break) to avoid excessive CPU usage. (break) Finally, (break) if the auto-save interval has elapsed, (break) we save the current statistics to file. (long-break)
