Let's implement the file management system. (long-break) The ShouldAutoSave and ShouldLog functions check if enough time has elapsed, (break) preventing excessive file writes and log spam. (long-break) SaveStatsToFile opens a CSV file and writes all current statistics. (break) The file includes a header row, (break) then a data row with timestamp, peak equity, drawdown values, (break) trade counts, win rate, and profit metrics. (break) This CSV format can be imported into Excel for analysis. (long-break) LoadStatsFromFile does the opposite. (break) It checks if a previous stats file exists, (break) opens it, (break) skips the header, (break) and reads the most recent statistics. (break) This allows the EA to resume monitoring from where it left off, (break) preserving your peak equity and maximum drawdown across restarts. (long-break)
