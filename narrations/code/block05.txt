Let's implement the On Init function, (break) which runs once when the EA starts. (long-break) First, we print a nice header to the terminal so you know the EA is running. (break) Then we grab the current account balance and equity. (long-break) If auto-save is enabled, (break) we try to load previous statistics from file. (break) This is crucial, (break) because it allows the EA to remember your peak equity and maximum drawdown, (break) even after restarting MetaTrader. (long-break) If no previous stats exist, (break) we initialize the peak equity based on the chosen mode, (break) either current equity or current balance. (break) Then we calculate all historical statistics from closed trades. (long-break) If the dashboard is enabled, (break) we create all the visual objects on the chart. (break) Finally, we initialize the timestamps and print a confirmation message. (long-break)
