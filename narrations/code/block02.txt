Next up, (break) we define three important enumerations. (long-break) The first one is ENUM CORNER POSITION, (break) which allows users to choose where the dashboard appears on their chart. (break) Top left, top right, bottom left, or bottom right. (long-break) Then we have ENUM DRAWDOWN MODE. (break) This is really important. (break) Equity-based drawdown includes your floating profit and loss, (break) so it responds immediately to market movements. (break) Balance-based drawdown, (break) on the other hand, (break) only counts closed trades, (break) giving you a more conservative measurement. (long-break) Finally, (break) the ENUM KILLSWITCH TRIGGER determines how the protection system activates. (break) Current drawdown resets when you reach a new peak, (break) while maximum drawdown tracks your worst performance ever, (break) which is what most prop firms use. (long-break)
