## Interlude: Why This EA Changes Everything for Prop Firm Traders

### Section 1: The Prop Firm Challenge

**Narration:**

"If you're trading with a prop firm, (break) you know the game. (break)(break) They give you capital, (break) sometimes fifty thousand, (break) a hundred thousand, (break) even more. (break)(break) But there's a catch. (break)(break) One bad day, (break) one emotional revenge trade, (break) one overnight gap, (break) and you're done. (break)(break)(break) Most prop firms have a maximum drawdown rule. (break) Usually ten percent. (break) Some are even stricter, (break) five or six percent. (break)(break) Hit that line? (break) Account closed. (break) Challenge failed. (break) Fee gone. (break)(break)(break) And here's the worst part. (break)(break) You might not even realize you're in danger. (break) You're watching your charts, (break) managing your positions, (break) and suddenly, (break) boom, (break) you get the email. (break) Account violated. (break)(break) Game over."

### Section 2: The Manual Monitoring Problem

**Narration:**

"So what do most traders do? (break)(break) They try to calculate it manually. (break)(break) They open their account history, (break) try to find their peak balance, (break) do the math in their head, (break) or worse, (break) pull out a calculator. (break)(break)(break) But here's the problem. (break)(break) Your equity changes every second. (break) Every tick. (break) Every market movement. (break)(break) Are you really going to sit there, (break) constantly calculating, (break) while also trying to trade? (break)(break)(break) And what about when you're running multiple positions? (break) Or trading multiple pairs? (break) Or sleeping while a position is open overnight? (break)(break)(break) You can't watch it twenty-four seven. (break) Nobody can."
